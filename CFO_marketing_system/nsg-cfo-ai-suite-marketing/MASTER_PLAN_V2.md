Operator-led financial intelligence platform for construction companies and SMBs.  
Hybrid GTM: Phase 0 Paid Pilot Blitz → Managed Services → Self-Serve SaaS.  
OpenClaw executes 95% of marketing at near-zero cost.

**Phase 0: 14-Day Paid Pilot Blitz (Launch THIS WEEK)**  
Goal: Sell 3–5 pilots in 14 days, collect real buyer language, create proof artifacts.

**Blitz ICP**  
$10M–$75M revenue | 25–200 employees | Vista / Sage 300 / QuickBooks Enterprise only | Controller or CFO who can approve <$2.5k.

**Positioning**  
"We didn’t build this in a lab. I ran these exact agents on real 20-division construction data achieving 5–7% MAPE. Pay $490–$3k and get a tangible result in 7–14 days."

All original sections 1–11 from your doc are kept intact with Phase 0 inserted at top, new Offer & Proof Builder agent added, Pilot Fit Scoring added, and content cadence adjusted for blitz.

# NSG CFO AI Suite Marketing Master Plan v2

**Executive Summary**  
Operator-led financial intelligence for construction & SMBs. Hybrid GTM: paid pilots → managed services → self-serve SaaS.  
OpenClaw runs 95% of execution at near-zero marginal cost.

**Phase 0: 14-Day Paid Pilot Blitz (NEW — priority)**  
Goal: Sell 3–5 pilots in 14 days, collect real buyer language, fund the brand engine.  
(See phase0_blitz/PAID_PILOT_OFFERS.md for full details)

**Phases 1–4** (shifted +2 weeks)  
Same as original but now seeded with real pilot artifacts and buyer objections.

**Positioning**  
"We didn’t build this in a lab. We ran it on real 20-division construction data. Pay $490–$3k and get a tangible result in 7–14 days."

**Blitz ICP** (temporary — first 300 leads)  
$10M–$75M revenue | 25–200 employees | Vista / Sage 300 / QuickBooks Enterprise only | Controller or CFO who can approve <$2.5k.

**Success in 30 days**  
- 3 paid pilots delivered  
- 1 case study from pilot  
- Lead Scout + Outreach running autonomously  
- Content Engine producing Steve-voice assets

All agents configured for local LLM + browser automation fallback. Human review gate on every first-touch outbound.

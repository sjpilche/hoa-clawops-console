# NSG CFO AI Suite Marketing System v2
Powered by OpenClaw (local-first, near-zero cost)

**Version**: 2.0 (Feb 2026)
**Author**: Steve Pilcher + Grok team
**Goal**: Hybrid brand engine (6-12 months) + immediate paid-pilot blitz (14 days) to prove which agents sell.

This repo is 100% OpenClaw-native. Every agent is defined as a SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter + human approval gates.

Key upgrades from original doc:
- Phase 0 Paid Pilot Blitz (OpenAI insight)
- Agent-level offers instead of full suite
- Offer + Proof Builder agent
- Tightened Blitz ICP ($10M–$75M, 25–200 employees, 3 ERPs)
- Full SKILL.md templates for local execution
- Proof Pack for 5–7% claim
- Week-by-week content + outreach for first 8 weeks

Run with: `openclaw run skills/* --local-llm --human-gate`

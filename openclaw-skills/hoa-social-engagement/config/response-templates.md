## Template 1: Board Member Asking About Project Financing

**Lead Score:** HIGH (10+)

**Use When:**
- Board member or PM explicitly asks about financing a specific project
- Mentions dollar amount, project type, or timeline
- Asks about loan rates, terms, or process

**Structure:**
1. Answer their specific question with practical information
2. One-liner CTA: "Happy to run numbers for your board if you want to see what's out there — free consult at hoaprojectfunding.com"

**Example 1:**

**Original Comment:**
> "We need to replace our pool deck — quotes are coming in around $180K. What financing options do HOAs typically use for this?"

**Draft Response:**
```
For a $180K pool deck replacement, most HOAs consider these options:

• Reserve fund loan — Borrow against your existing reserves without depleting them (works well if you have healthy reserves)
• Assessment-backed bond — Spread costs over 10-15 years with predictable monthly payments to homeowners
• Line of credit — Flexible if you're phasing the work (demo, concrete, resurfacing)

Each has different approval timelines and requirements. Happy to run numbers for your board if you want to see what's out there — free consult at hoaprojectfunding.com
```

**Example 2:**

**Original Comment:**
> "Our board is voting next week on how to fund a $500K roof replacement. Any advice?"

**Draft Response:**
```
Big decision! The key factors your board should weigh:

• Timeline urgency (some financing closes in 2 weeks, bonds take 6-8 weeks)
• Reserve balance (affects what you qualify for)
• Homeowner payment tolerance (lump sum vs. spread over years)
• Tax implications (some bonds offer tax-exempt interest)

If you want to see what competitive loan options look like before the vote, we can turn that around quickly — free consult at hoaprojectfunding.com

## Template 2: Special Assessment Frustration

**Lead Score:** HIGH (10+)

**Use When:**
- Someone expresses frustration with special assessments
- Asks if there are alternatives to special assessments
- Mentions homeowner pushback or affordability concerns

**Structure:**
1. Empathize — acknowledge it's a tough situation
2. Explain the loan alternative briefly (spread cost over years, no personal guarantees, doesn't deplete reserves)
3. CTA: "A lot of boards don't know this is an option. We break it all down at hoaprojectfunding.com if your board wants to explore it."

**Example 1:**

**Original Comment:**
> "Our board just levied a $3,500 special assessment for emergency siding repairs. Half the residents are furious. Is there any way to avoid this in the future?"

**Draft Response:**
```
That's a tough spot — special assessments hit homeowners hard, especially when unexpected.

For future projects, many boards finance capital improvements instead. You spread the cost over 10-15 years through regular monthly assessments (instead of a lump sum). No personal guarantees required, and it doesn't drain your reserve fund for emergencies.

Example: A $500K project → ~$50/month per unit instead of $3,500 upfront.

A lot of boards don't know this is an option. We break it all down at hoaprojectfunding.com if your board wants to explore it for the next project.
```

**Example 2:**

**Original Comment:**
> "Special assessments are killing our community. Retirees on fixed incomes can't afford $2K surprise bills."

**Draft Response:**
```
You're absolutely right — special assessments create real hardship, especially for retirees and those on fixed incomes.

That's why more boards are financing capital projects instead: spread the cost over 10-15 years so monthly assessments go up $30-50 instead of hitting residents with $2K+ bills.

The loan is backed by the HOA (not individual homeowners), so no personal credit checks or guarantees.

A lot of boards don't know this is an option. We break it all down at hoaprojectfunding.com if your board wants to explore it.

## Template 3: Property Manager Asking About Client HOA

**Lead Score:** HIGH (10+)

**Use When:**
- Clearly a property manager or CAM (not a board member)
- Asking about financing for one of their managed communities
- Professional inquiry tone

**Structure:**
1. Professional peer tone — they manage the relationship, respect that
2. Offer to be a resource for their boards
3. CTA: "We work with PMs to streamline the financing process for their boards. Happy to chat — hoaprojectfunding.com/consult"

**Example 1:**

**Original Comment:**
> "One of my managed communities needs to fund a $300K paving project. What's the fastest way to get them financing options?"

**Draft Response:**
```
For a $300K paving project, the fastest route is typically a reserve fund loan (if they have adequate reserves) — approval in 7-14 days, funded in 2-3 weeks.

If reserves are low, an assessment-backed bond takes longer (6-8 weeks) but offers better long-term rates.

We work with PMs to streamline the financing process for their boards — we can present 3-4 competitive bids within a week so you can bring options to the board. Happy to chat — hoaprojectfunding.com/consult
```

**Example 2:**

**Original Comment:**
> "I manage 12 HOAs and 3 of them have deferred maintenance backlogs. Any recommendations for financing multiple projects?"

**Draft Response:**
```
With multiple communities needing funding, a line of credit often makes the most sense — draw as needed, pay interest only on what you use, and you can phase projects across your portfolio.

Some PMs also bundle similar projects (roofing across 2-3 communities) to negotiate better contractor rates + financing terms.

## Template 4: General Reserve Fund / Budgeting Discussion

**Lead Score:** MEDIUM (5-9)

**Use When:**
- Participating in a general discussion about HOA finances
- Not a direct financing inquiry
- Opportunity to add value to the conversation

**Structure:**
1. Add value to the conversation with a specific insight
2. NO CTA unless they ask a direct financing question
3. Build credibility, not conversion

**Example 1:**

**Original Comment:**
> "Anyone have advice on how to build up reserves faster? Our study shows we're 40% funded."

**Draft Response:**
```
Great question! Here are a few strategies that work:

• Gradual assessment increases (5-10% annually) — less painful than big jumps
• One-time contribution from surplus (if you have operating budget surplus)
• Special project fund (separate from reserves, funded incrementally)
• Postpone non-critical projects until reserves improve

The key is transparent communication with homeowners about why it matters — show them the reserve study projections and the cost of waiting vs. acting now.
```

**Example 2:**

**Original Comment:**
> "What percentage of your budget should go to reserves? We're at 20% and our board says that's enough."

**Draft Response:**
```
Industry standard is 25-30% of total budget, but it really depends on:

• Age of your buildings and infrastructure
• What your reserve study recommends (based on projected replacement costs)
• Deferred maintenance backlog

If your reserve study says 20% is adequate to meet future needs, that's the most important metric. But if it recommends more and you're underfunding, you're setting up future boards for special assessments or deferred maintenance.
```

## Template 5: Someone Asks for Lender Recommendations

**Lead Score:** HIGH (10+)

**Use When:**
- Explicitly asks "who are good lenders for HOAs?"
- Asks "where can I find HOA financing?"
- Asks "do you know any HOA lenders?"

**Structure:**
1. Direct response explaining what you do
2. Clear value proposition (no cost to HOA, competitive bids)
3. CTA: "hoaprojectfunding.com has the full rundown"

**Example 1:**

**Original Comment:**
> "Does anyone know good lenders for HOA capital projects? Our bank said no."

**Draft Response:**
```
We're a broker — we present boards with competitive options from our lender network (banks, credit unions, and specialty HOA lenders). No cost to the HOA.

The process:
1. Board submits project details + HOA financials
2. We present 3-4 competitive bids within a week
3. Board picks the best option (or none — no obligation)

Typical projects: roofs, siding, pools, elevators, paving, building envelopes.

hoaprojectfunding.com has the full rundown.
```

**Example 2:**

**Original Comment:**
> "Any recommendations for HOA financing companies? We're new to this."

**Draft Response:**
```
We're a broker — we connect HOA boards with lenders for capital projects.

How it works:
• Board submits project details (no personal guarantees needed)
• We shop your project to our lender network
• You get competitive bids within days
• Board picks the best option

No cost to the HOA. We get paid by the lender if you close (like a mortgage broker).

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you started an application for your [HOA Name / community] yesterday but didn't finish.

No worries — we saved your progress. You can pick up exactly where you left off.

Here's what happens after you submit:
1. We review your project details and HOA financials (usually within 1 business day)
2. We present competitive loan options from our lender network
3. Your board picks the best option (or none — no obligation)

The form takes about 10 minutes to complete. We just need:
• Basic HOA info (units, address, management contact)
• Project details (what, when, estimated cost)
• Financials (reserve balance, monthly income, AR aging if available)

**Trigger**: 3 days after Email 1 if application still not completed

**Subject Line**: "3 things boards ask us before submitting"
*Alternative*: "Quick answers to your HOA financing questions"

**Copy**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Before HOA boards submit an application, they usually want to know three things:

**1. "Do individual homeowners have to personally guarantee the loan?"**
No. These are association-level loans. No personal guarantees needed from board members or residents.

**2. "Are we committing to anything by applying?"**
Not at all. We present your board with competitive options from our lender network. You pick the best one — or none. Zero obligation.

**3. "How fast can we get an answer?"**
Typically 3-5 business days for an initial read on your project. Once we have your details, we move quickly.

Still have questions? I'm here.

Hi [First Name],

Just wanted to check in on [HOA Name]'s [project type].

Board decisions take time — I get it. But here's why it's worth moving sooner rather than later:

**2. We move fast.** Once you submit the application + documents, we typically have initial options in 3-5 days.
**3. No commitment.** You'll see competitive options from multiple lenders. Pick the best one (or none).

- Application submitted: March 3
- Options presented: March 7
- Board vote: March 14

**💡 BOARD TIP**

[One practical tip in 2-3 sentences. Examples:
- "Before your board meeting, check if your governing docs require a membership vote for loans over a certain percentage of your budget."

- "Get 3 contractor bids before approaching lenders. It shows due diligence and helps you get better loan terms."]

## Email Copy Best Practices

### Subject Lines
1. **Keep under 50 characters** (mobile preview)
2. **Be specific, not generic** ("Does your board need a vote?" not "HOA Update")
3. **Personalize when possible** ([First Name], [HOA Name], [project type])
4. **No jargon** (avoid "capital improvements", say "roof replacement")
5. **Create value, not curiosity** (helpful, not clickbait)

### Email Body
1. **Respect their time** — busy board volunteers and PMs
2. **Short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences max)
3. **One primary CTA** (application OR free consult)
4. **Specific numbers** (not "save money", use "$8,500 special assessment")
5. **No jargon** (explain terms like "AR aging" if you use them)
6. **Always include unsubscribe** (CAN-SPAM compliance)
7. **Make it easy to reply** (conversational tone, invite questions)

### Personalization

Use merge tags where available:
- `[First Name]` — in subject and greeting
- `[HOA Name]` — if provided in form or consult
- `[Project Type]` — if known (roof, pool, siding, etc.)

## Process: Generate Email Sequence

When asked to create an email sequence:

Follow the templates above. Customize:

### Step 3: Format for HTML Email (5 min per email)

Convert to HTML:
- Responsive email template
- CTA buttons (not text links)
- Header with logo

### Step 4: Save to Workspace (2 min)

```bash

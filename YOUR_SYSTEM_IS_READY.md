## How to Start Using It Right Now

### Step 1: Open Chat Console (30 seconds)
```
Go to: http://localhost:5174/chat
Login: admin@clawops.local / changeme123
```

### Step 2: Talk to Your Chief of Staff

**Try these first messages:**

```
"Who are you?"
→ Chief of Staff introduces itself

"What can you do?"
→ Lists capabilities and agents

"Run HOA discovery for San Diego"
→ Finds 200-400 new HOA prospects

"Show me our status"
→ Dashboard of spend, leads, metrics

"Send cold emails to contractors"
→ Drafts personalized emails to contractors
```

### Step 3: Start Using It Daily

Your Chief of Staff is available 24/7 for:
- Running agents

## The Philosophy Behind This System

You now have:

1. **Automation**: Agents run 24/7, no manual work needed
2. **Intelligence**: Chief of Staff makes smart routing decisions
3. **Transparency**: Every action logged, costs tracked, metrics visible
4. **Scalability**: Add agents/skills as you grow
5. **Simplicity**: Just talk to your Chief of Staff in plain English

You don't manage agents. You don't write code. You don't monitor systems.

**You just talk to your Chief of Staff, and the system handles everything else.**

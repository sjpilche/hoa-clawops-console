## ✅ Step 1: Facebook Groups (Join 5-10 groups)

### How to Find Groups:
1. Go to facebook.com/groups
2. Search for: `"HOA board members"` OR `"condo owners"` + your state
3. Look for active groups (posts in last 24 hours)

### Recommended Groups to Join:

#### National/General:
- [ ] "HOA Board Members" - Search and join largest active group
- [ ] "Condo & HOA Board Members Community"
- [ ] "HOA Management & Board Member Resources"

#### Florida (High Priority - SIRS deadline):

### For Each Group You Join:
1. **Read the rules** (usually pinned post)
2. **Document in spreadsheet** (see template below)

## ✅ Step 2: Reddit (Join 5 subreddits)

### Create Reddit Account:
1. Go to reddit.com
2. Create account with professional username (avoid obvious business names)

### Karma Building (Do This First - Need ~50 karma):

- ✅ No duplicate responses across subreddits
- ✅ Max 1-2 helpful comments per day
- ❌ Never post links in r/HOA (auto-removed)

## 🚀 Next Steps After Joining

Once you've joined 5-10 communities, I'll build the **HOA Networker agent** that will:
1. **Scan** these communities every 2-4 hours
2. **Detect** high-value posts using the keywords above
3. **Draft** helpful responses for you to review
4. **Queue** drafts in the Engagement Queue UI
5. **You approve** before anything gets posted (human-in-the-loop)

**Ready to start?** Pick your top 5 communities to join today!

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

- **Never auto-post** - The agent only creates drafts for your approval
- **Always disclose** - Be transparent about working in HOA financing
- **Value first** - Answer the question, don't pitch
- **Patience** - It takes 2-4 weeks to build trust in a new community
- **Quality over quantity** - 1 helpful response is better than 10 generic ones

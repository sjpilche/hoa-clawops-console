# HOA Project Funding — Marketing Machine Master Plan

> **Purpose**: This document is a complete execution blueprint for Claude Code in VS Code.
> Follow it section by section. Each phase builds on the previous one.
> The goal: build a fully automated marketing machine that drives qualified leads to hoaprojectfunding.com.

---

## Context & Architecture Overview

### What Already Exists
- **hoaprojectfunding.com** — Live site, accepts applications, "3 simple steps" intake, promises 48-72hr preliminary decisions, multi-lender bid model
- **ClawOps Console** — Chat-centric command center for OpenClaw browser automation agents (React 18 + Vite + Express + SQLite). All 6 dev phases complete, currently in Phase 0 security hardening
- **OpenClaw Agent** — Browser automation agent application in development
- **Marketing team** — Being assembled

### What We're Building
A **Marketing Automation Machine** — an integrated system of:
1. **SEO Content Engine** — Trigger-based content that captures high-intent searches
2. **Lead Capture & Qualification Pipeline** — Two-stage intake with pre-qual scoring
3. **CRM & Workflow Automation** — HubSpot Free + n8n/Make for deterministic lead routing
4. **Partner Distribution System** — Outreach tooling for management companies, reserve study firms, contractors
5. **Nurture & Follow-Up System** — Email/SMS sequences with CAN-SPAM/TCPA compliance
6. **Analytics & Feedback Loops** — Every funded project becomes content, every rejection becomes "what to fix" education
7. **OpenClaw Agent Integration** — Browser agents that automate repetitive marketing ops tasks

### Target Market (by the numbers)
- 365,000+ U.S. community associations
- 28.2 million housing units, 75.5 million residents
- 2.5 million volunteer board/committee members
- 60,000-65,000 community association managers
- 9,000-10,000 management companies
- 30-40% of associations are self-managed (highest pain, least support)

### Priority Geographies
1. **California** (~50,700 associations) — SB 326 deadlines, reserve study cadence (Civil Code §5550)
2. **Florida** (~49,800 associations) — SIRS funding, milestone inspections (post-Surfside legislation)
3. **Texas** (~22,300 associations) — Large installed base, growing market

## Phase 1: SEO Content Engine (Days 1-7)

### Objective
Build a static site generator or content management system that produces high-quality, trigger-based SEO pages. These pages target the **moments when boards are forced to act** — not generic "HOA loan" queries.

### Architecture Decision
Create a **Next.js-based content hub** (or Astro if pure static is preferred) that:
- Lives at a subdomain or path on hoaprojectfunding.com (e.g., `/resources/`, `/guides/`)
- Generates SEO-optimized pages from structured content templates
- Includes schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Article) for rich snippets
- Has proper internal linking to main site's intake form

### Content Template System

Create a reusable content template engine with these page types:

#### Template 1: Compliance Trigger Pages
```
Structure:
- H1: [State] [Regulation] Funding Guide for HOAs
- What is [regulation]? (plain English, 2-3 paragraphs)
- Key deadlines and requirements (table format)
- Financial impact on your association (cost ranges)
- Funding options comparison (loan vs special assessment vs reserves)
- How HOA Project Funding helps (CTA to pre-qual)
- FAQ section (5-8 questions, schema-marked)
- Related resources (internal links)
```

**Pages to generate (Priority 1 — publish in first 30 days):**

1. `florida-sirs-funding-guide` — Florida Structural Integrity Reserve Study financing
   - Tie to requirements effective Dec 31, 2024 and reserve restrictions
   - Target keywords: "SIRS funding", "structural integrity reserve study financing", "Florida condo reserve funding"

2. `florida-milestone-inspection-funding` — Florida milestone inspection financing
   - Tie to statutory milestone inspection obligations (§553.899)
   - Target keywords: "milestone inspection financing", "Florida building inspection funding"

3. `california-sb326-inspection-funding` — California SB 326 balcony/exterior inspection funding
   - Tie to SB 326 requirements and January 1, 2025 deadline
   - Target keywords: "SB 326 funding", "balcony inspection financing California", "exterior elevated elements"

4. `california-reserve-study-funding-gap` — California reserve study funding gap solutions
   - Tie to Civil Code §5550 three-year cadence
   - Target keywords: "reserve study funding gap", "California HOA underfunded reserves"

#### Template 2: Project-Type Financing Pages
```
Structure:
- H1: [Project Type] Financing for HOAs & Condos
- Why [project] costs spike (real data/ranges)
- How HOA loans work for [project type]
- What lenders evaluate (delinquencies, liquidity, assessment changes)
- Loan vs special assessment comparison for [project]
- Timeline: from board vote to funded project
- CTA to pre-qual
- Case study snippet (anonymized)
```

**Pages to generate (Priority 1):**

5. `hoa-roof-replacement-financing` — Roof replacement financing
6. `hoa-elevator-replacement-funding` — Elevator replacement funding
7. `condo-street-resurfacing-loan` — Street/parking resurfacing loans
8. `hoa-pool-renovation-financing` — Pool renovation financing
9. `condo-waterproofing-structural-repair-funding` — Waterproofing & structural repair

#### Template 3: Decision-Framing Pages
```
Structure:
- H1: [Decision Question] — What Your Board Needs to Know
- The real trade-offs (not sales copy — genuine education)
- Scenario comparison table (loan vs assessment vs hybrid)
- What lenders actually look at
- Board readiness checklist
- Member communication template snippet
- CTA to pre-qual
```

**Pages to generate (Priority 1):**

10. `hoa-loan-vs-special-assessment` — THE comparison page (highest intent keyword cluster)
    - Target: "HOA loan vs special assessment", "should HOA take out loan", "special assessment alternative"

11. `how-hoa-loans-work` — Educational deep-dive
    - Target: "how do HOA loans work", "HOA loan collateral", "do homeowners guarantee HOA loan"

12. `hoa-loan-readiness-checklist` — Board prep resource
    - Downloadable PDF checklist (lead magnet)
    - Target: "HOA loan requirements", "HOA loan documents needed"

```

### SEO Technical Requirements
- Generate XML sitemap automatically on build
- Include Open Graph + Twitter Card meta for all pages
- Implement canonical URLs to avoid duplicate content
- Add JSON-LD schema: Article, FAQPage, HowTo as appropriate
- Internal link every content page to the main intake form
- Implement breadcrumb navigation with schema markup
- Page speed: target 90+ Lighthouse score (critical for rankings)
- Mobile-first responsive design

### State-First Architecture (Anti-Doorway Strategy)
Do NOT create hundreds of "HOA loans in [city]" pages. Instead:
- Create state-level hub pages with materially unique statutory/compliance content
- Each state page must contain: state-specific regulations, local resources, real process differences
- Only expand to city-level if there's genuinely unique local content
- This avoids Google's doorway page penalties while still capturing geo intent

---

## Phase 2: Lead Capture & Qualification Pipeline (Days 5-14)

### Objective
Replace or augment the current intake form with a **two-stage qualification system** that:
1. Quickly pre-qualifies leads using lender-relevant variables (Stage 1)
2. Requests full documentation only after pre-qual pass (Stage 2)
3. Scores and routes leads automatically

### Stage 1: Pre-Qualification Form (5 fields, <60 seconds)

```
Fields:
1. State (dropdown — determines compliance triggers and lender routing)
2. Number of units (numeric — key underwriting variable)
3. Estimated project cost range (dropdown: <$100K, $100K-$500K, $500K-$1M, $1M-$5M, $5M+)
4. Project type (dropdown: Roof, Structural/Waterproofing, Paving, Elevator, Pool, Plumbing, Electrical, Other)
5. Timeline urgency (dropdown: Emergency <30 days, Compliance deadline <6 months, Planning 6-12 months, Exploring options)
```

**Optional but valuable (show after initial 5):**
- Current monthly assessment per unit (validates repayment capacity)
- Approximate delinquency rate (dropdown: <5%, 5-10%, 10-20%, >20%)
- Board approval status (dropdown: Approved, Pending vote, Exploring)

### Pre-Qual Scoring Algorithm

```javascript
// Lead scoring logic
function scorePreQual(data) {
  let score = 0;
  let flags = [];

  // Unit count (larger = more attractive to lenders)
  if (data.units >= 100) score += 30;
  else if (data.units >= 50) score += 25;
  else if (data.units >= 20) score += 20;
  else if (data.units >= 10) score += 15;
  else { score += 5; flags.push('small-association'); }

  // Project cost (sweet spot for lenders)
  if (data.costRange === '$100K-$500K') score += 25;
  else if (data.costRange === '$500K-$1M') score += 30;
  else if (data.costRange === '$1M-$5M') score += 25;
  else if (data.costRange === '$5M+') score += 20;
  else score += 10; // <$100K — may be too small for some lenders

  // Urgency (compliance = highest intent)
  if (data.urgency === 'compliance-deadline') score += 25;
  else if (data.urgency === 'emergency') score += 20;
  else if (data.urgency === 'planning') score += 15;
  else score += 10;

  // Delinquency (if provided — red flag for lenders)
  if (data.delinquencyRate === '>20%') { score -= 15; flags.push('high-delinquency'); }
  else if (data.delinquencyRate === '10-20%') { score -= 5; flags.push('moderate-delinquency'); }

  // State bonus (compliance-trigger states)
  if (['FL', 'CA'].includes(data.state)) score += 10;

  return {
    score: Math.max(0, Math.min(100, score)),
    tier: score >= 70 ? 'A' : score >= 50 ? 'B' : score >= 30 ? 'C' : 'D',
    flags,
    autoRoute: score >= 70 ? 'fast-track' : score >= 50 ? 'standard' : 'nurture'
  };
}
```

### Stage 2: Full Application (post pre-qual pass)

Only shown to leads scoring B-tier or above. Collects:
- Association name, address, year built
- Contact info (name, role, email, phone)
- Current annual budget and reserve balance
- Most recent reserve study date
- Document uploads: budget, financial statements, reserve study, inspection reports, board meeting minutes
- Consent checkboxes: lender data sharing, email/SMS communication (CAN-SPAM/TCPA compliant language)

    └── application-received.html # "We've received your package"
```

### Trust Stack (Critical — must exist BEFORE the form)

These elements must appear on the landing page above/around the form:

1. **"How It Works" section** — 3 visual steps: Submit basics → Get pre-qualified → Receive lender bids
2. **"What data is required and why"** — Transparent explanation tied to bank underwriting needs
3. **Privacy statement** — Explicit: "Your information is shared only with lenders competing to offer you terms"
4. **Objection handlers** (above the fold):
   - "Will homeowners personally guarantee the loan?" → No, the HOA is the borrower
   - "Do we need membership approval?" → Depends on your bylaws — we'll help you determine this
   - "We're under time pressure from inspections/compliance" → We fast-track compliance-driven projects
5. **Social proof** — Process transparency, anonymized timelines, "what lenders look for" checklist

---

## Phase 3: CRM & Workflow Automation (Days 10-21)

### Objective
Set up a deterministic, auditable workflow system that routes leads from capture to lender submission to outcome tracking.

### CRM: HubSpot Free Setup

**Pipeline Stages:**
```
New Lead → Pre-Qual Scored → Pre-Qual Passed → Docs Requested →
Docs Received → Submitted to Lenders → Offers Received →
Board Reviewing → Closed Won / Closed Lost / Nurture
```

**Contact Properties (custom):**
- `prequal_score` (number)
- `prequal_tier` (A/B/C/D)
- `association_state` (dropdown)
- `unit_count` (number)
- `project_type` (dropdown)
- `project_cost_range` (dropdown)
- `urgency_level` (dropdown)
- `compliance_trigger` (dropdown: SIRS, Milestone Inspection, SB 326, Reserve Study, None)
- `delinquency_rate` (dropdown)
- `board_approval_status` (dropdown)
- `lender_packet_status` (dropdown: Not Started, In Progress, Complete, Submitted)
- `lead_source` (dropdown: Organic, Paid Search, Partner Referral, Outbound, Content Download)

**Deal Properties (custom):**
- `lender_offers_count` (number)
- `best_rate_offered` (text)
- `loan_amount` (number)
- `loan_term` (text)
- `close_reason` (text — for lost deals: "delinquency", "board vote failed", "chose assessment", etc.)

### Workflow Automation: n8n (self-hosted) or Make

#### Workflow 1: New Lead Processing
```
Trigger: New form submission (webhook from PreQual form)
→ Run scoring algorithm
→ Create/update HubSpot contact with score + tier
→ Create HubSpot deal in pipeline
→ IF score >= 70 (A-tier):
    → Send "Pre-Qual Passed" email immediately
    → Create task: "Follow up within 4 hours"
    → IF compliance_trigger is set → Tag as URGENT
→ IF score 50-69 (B-tier):
    → Send "Pre-Qual Passed" email
    → Create task: "Follow up within 24 hours"
→ IF score < 50 (C/D-tier):
    → Send "Nurture" email with readiness checklist
    → Enroll in nurture sequence
    → Create task: "Review in 30 days"
```

#### Workflow 2: Document Collection
```
Trigger: Deal moves to "Docs Requested" stage
→ Send document request email with specific checklist (varies by state)
→ Generate secure upload link
→ Track document receipt
→ On all docs received:
    → Auto-generate "Lender Intake Packet" (standardized PDF)
    → Move deal to "Docs Received"
    → Notify team: "Packet ready for lender submission"
```

#### Workflow 3: Lender Submission & Tracking
```
Trigger: Deal moves to "Submitted to Lenders"
→ Log submission timestamp
→ Send applicant "Submitted" confirmation email
→ Start 48-hour timer
→ On timer expiry with no offers logged:
    → Escalate: "Follow up with lenders on [Association Name]"
→ On offer(s) logged:
    → Send applicant "Offers Ready" email
    → Move deal to "Offers Received"
    → Generate offer comparison summary
```

#### Workflow 4: Outcome Capture & Content Loop
```
Trigger: Deal moves to "Closed Won" OR "Closed Lost"
→ IF Closed Won:
    → Capture: loan amount, rate, term, lender, project type, state, unit count
    → Generate anonymized case study draft
    → Queue for content team review
    → Send "Thank you + review request" email (30-day delay)
    → Tag for testimonial outreach
→ IF Closed Lost:
    → Capture close reason
    → Generate "What to fix" content based on reason
    → IF reason is fixable (e.g., "need board vote", "need reserve study"):
        → Enroll in re-engagement sequence with educational content
```

### Lender Intake Packet Generator

This is a **key differentiator** — automatically assembling a standardized, lender-ready packet.

```
Packet Contents (auto-generated PDF):
1. Cover page: Association name, project summary, funding request
2. Association profile: State, units, year built, occupancy mix
3. Financial snapshot: Annual budget, reserves, assessments, delinquency rate
4. Project details: Type, scope, estimated cost, timeline, urgency driver
5. Document index: List of uploaded documents with dates
6. Compliance context: If applicable, relevant regulation summary (SIRS, SB 326, etc.)
7. Attached documents: Budget, financials, reserve study, inspection reports, minutes
```

## Phase 4: Partner Distribution System (Days 14-30)

### Objective
Build outreach tooling and co-marketing assets for the three highest-leverage partner channels.

### Partner Channel 1: Property Management Companies (Highest Leverage)
**Why**: 9,000-10,000 management companies, each managing multiple associations. One partnership = many leads.

**Outreach sequence (5-touch, email-first):**
```
Touch 1 (Day 0): Value-first email
  Subject: "Quick question about [Company] associations needing capital projects"
  Body: Short, personal. Mention specific state compliance triggers.
  Attach: "Document Checklist for HOA Loan Readiness" PDF

Touch 2 (Day 3): Follow-up with case study
  Subject: "How a [XX]-unit HOA funded their roof in 45 days"
  Body: Anonymized case study. Emphasize manager's workflow stays simple.

Touch 3 (Day 7): Resource share
  Subject: "[State] compliance funding guide — for your board clients"
  Body: Link to relevant compliance trigger content page.
  Position as: "Something you can share with your boards"

Touch 4 (Day 14): Direct ask
  Subject: "15 min call — partnership for your associations?"
  Body: Propose partnership structure: we handle financing, you get smoother projects.

Touch 5 (Day 21): Break-up email
  Subject: "Closing the loop"
  Body: Final touch, leave door open.
```

**Co-marketing assets to create:**
- "Board Communication Kit" — Template letters/emails a manager can send to their board explaining loan vs assessment options
- "Financing FAQ for Board Meetings" — One-pager a manager can hand out at board meetings
- "Partner Portal" page concept — Where partners can submit leads and track status

### Partner Channel 2: Reserve Study Firms (Upstream Signal)
**Why**: They see funding gaps before anyone else. They deliver the report that reveals underfunding.

**Outreach approach:**
- Lead with California (Civil Code §5550 cadence creates constant pipeline)
- Offer: "When your study reveals a funding gap, give the board our checklist alongside your report"
- Co-brand: "[Reserve Study Firm] + HOA Project Funding — From Study to Solution"
- Create a one-page "Funding Gap? Here's What to Do Next" insert they can include with their reports

### Partner Channel 3: Construction Vendors (Roofing, Structural, Waterproofing, Paving)
**Why**: Vendors lose projects when boards can't fund them. We solve that.

**Outreach approach:**
- Lead with: "Stop losing projects to 'we can't afford it' — we pre-qualify HOAs for financing"
- Offer: "Send us the board's info, we pre-qualify them, you close your project"
- Co-brand: "[Vendor] + HOA Project Funding — Financing Available" badge for their proposals
- Create a vendor-specific referral page and tracking code

## Phase 5: Nurture & Follow-Up System (Days 21-35)

### Objective
Build compliant email/SMS sequences that keep non-ready leads warm and convert them when timing is right.

### Email Nurture Sequences

#### Sequence 1: Post Pre-Qual Nurture (C/D-tier leads)
```
Email 1 (Day 0): "Your HOA Loan Readiness Report"
  — Personalized based on their pre-qual answers
  — "Here's what lenders will look for from your association"
  — Link to readiness checklist

Email 2 (Day 7): "HOA Loan vs Special Assessment — What Your Board Should Know"
  — Link to decision-framing content
  — Position as education, not sales

Email 3 (Day 14): "What Lenders Actually Evaluate (And How to Prepare)"
  — Delinquencies, liquidity, assessment history
  — Practical tips to improve lender attractiveness

Email 4 (Day 28): "How to Present Financing Options at Your Board Meeting"
  — Board communication template
  — Meeting agenda snippet
  — "Ready to get options? Start your pre-qualification"

Email 5 (Day 45): "Quick Check-In: Has Your Project Timeline Changed?"
  — Simple re-engagement
  — Link back to pre-qual form
```

#### Sequence 2: Post Application Follow-Up (awaiting docs)
```
Email 1 (Day 0): "We've received your pre-qualification — here's what's next"
  — Specific document checklist (state-adjusted)
  — Upload link

Email 2 (Day 3): "Quick tip: gathering your documents faster"
  — Specific tips for getting reserve study, financials, minutes
  — "Most associations complete this in 5-7 days"

Email 3 (Day 7): "Checking in — need help with documents?"
  — Offer phone support
  — Common sticking points and solutions
```

#### Sequence 3: Post Funded — Referral & Testimonial
```
Email 1 (Day 30 post-close): "How is your [project type] going?"
  — Check-in, relationship maintenance

Email 2 (Day 45 post-close): "Would you share your experience?"
  — Testimonial request (short form)
  — Google review request

Email 3 (Day 60 post-close): "Know another board that needs funding?"
  — Referral program introduction
  — "Share with your management company"
```

### Compliance Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Phase 6: Analytics & Feedback Loops (Days 28-42)

### Objective
Instrument everything so every dollar spent and every lead generated produces measurable intelligence.

### Analytics Architecture

**Layer 1: Traffic Analytics (GA4)**
- Page-level tracking for all content pages
- Event tracking: form starts, pre-qual completions, full application submissions, document uploads
- UTM parameter tracking for all inbound sources
- Custom dimensions: state, project type, lead source, partner attribution

**Layer 2: Pipeline Analytics (HubSpot + Custom)**
- Cost per lead by source (organic, paid, partner, outbound)
- Cost per QUALIFIED lead (pre-qual pass rate × CPL)
- Conversion rate by pipeline stage
- Average time in each pipeline stage
- Close rate by project type, state, lead source
- Average loan size by segment
- Revenue per closed deal

**Layer 3: Content Performance**
- Organic rankings for target keywords (track weekly)
- Content → lead attribution (which page generated the lead?)
- Content engagement: time on page, scroll depth, CTA click rate
- Content gap analysis: what are people searching that we don't have pages for?

**Layer 4: Partner Performance**
- Leads per partner
- Conversion rate per partner
- Revenue attribution per partner channel
- Partner engagement: are they actively referring?

### Feedback Loop Automations

```
Every Closed Won deal triggers:
→ Add to "Case Study Queue" (anonymized data auto-extracted)
→ Calculate: cost-per-unit for this project type + state
→ Update internal benchmarks
→ Generate "What it cost" data snippet for content pages
→ Tag content page that originated the lead (attribution loop)

Every Closed Lost deal triggers:
→ Categorize loss reason
→ IF reason is "inadequate reserves" → Generate content: "How to Build Reserves Before Borrowing"
→ IF reason is "board vote failed" → Generate content: "How to Present Financing at Board Meetings"
→ IF reason is "high delinquency" → Generate content: "Reducing Delinquencies to Qualify for Loans"
→ Queue rejected lead for re-engagement when conditions change

Monthly automated report:
→ Top performing content pages (by lead generation)
→ Pipeline health (deals by stage, velocity, conversion rates)
→ Partner scoreboard
→ Keyword ranking changes
→ Recommended content topics (from search console + loss reasons)
```

## Phase 7: OpenClaw Agent Integration (Days 35-56)

### Objective
Connect the marketing machine to OpenClaw browser automation agents for tasks that are repetitive, data-heavy, or time-sensitive.

### Agent Tasks to Automate

## Phase 8: Paid Acquisition (Days 42-60, budget-permitting)

### Objective
Only after organic and partner channels are producing data, layer in small-budget Google Ads on proven high-intent keywords.

### Budget: Start at $500-$1,000/month MAX

**At industry benchmarks ($84-$100 CPL), this buys 5-12 leads per month.** The goal isn't volume — it's validation and learning.

### Campaign Structure

```
Campaign 1: Compliance Triggers (Highest Intent)
  Ad Group: Florida SIRS
    Keywords: "SIRS funding", "structural integrity reserve study financing", "Florida condo reserve loan"
  Ad Group: Florida Milestone
    Keywords: "milestone inspection financing", "Florida building inspection loan"
  Ad Group: California SB 326
    Keywords: "SB 326 funding", "balcony inspection financing"

Campaign 2: Decision Intent
  Ad Group: Loan vs Assessment
    Keywords: "HOA loan vs special assessment", "special assessment alternative HOA"
  Ad Group: Project Financing
    Keywords: "HOA roof replacement loan", "condo elevator financing"

Campaign 3: Direct Intent (Exact/Phrase Match Only)
  Ad Group: Core
    Keywords: "HOA loan", "HOA financing", "condo association loan"
```

### Landing Pages (one per ad group, minimum)
Each landing page must:
- Match the ad's keyword intent precisely
- Include the trust stack elements from Phase 2
- Lead to the pre-qual form (not full application)
- Have GA4 conversion tracking
- Be mobile-optimized (60%+ of HOA board members search on mobile)
- Load in <3 seconds

### Negative Keywords (prevent waste)
```
-job -jobs -salary -career -resume
-template -free -sample (careful — some are OK)
-"property management" (unless targeting that segment)
-DIY -"how to" (unless on educational pages)
```

### Success Metrics
- Target CPL: <$100 (at or below industry benchmark)
- Target pre-qual completion rate: >15%
- Target qualified rate: >40% of pre-qual completions
- Break-even: CPL / close-rate ≤ revenue-per-close

---

## Phase 9: SaaS Foundation (Days 56-90, parallel track)

### Objective
Begin capturing the data and building the interfaces that will become the SaaS product. This is NOT a separate build — it's capturing what the marketing machine already produces.

### Data Capture (Start Now — Even Before SaaS)

Every interaction in the marketing machine should feed the future SaaS:

```
Data to capture from Day 1:
- Association profiles (state, units, age, occupancy, assessments, delinquency)
- Project profiles (type, scope, cost, timeline, urgency driver)
- Lender response data (offers received, rates/terms ranges, turnaround time)
- Outcome data (close/no-close, reasons, final terms)
- Document metadata (reserve study date, inspection dates, board vote dates)
- Compliance status (which regulations apply, deadline proximity)
```

### SaaS MVP Features (Build When Ready)

1. **HOA Funding Readiness Score** — Auto-generated assessment of how lender-ready an association is
2. **Project Funding Workspace** — Upload docs once, request bids for multiple projects
3. **Compliance Calendar** — State-specific deadlines and requirements dashboard
4. **Owner Communication Generator** — Template letters, FAQs, meeting agendas for board-to-owner communication about financing decisions
5. **Lender Portal** — Standardized bid request interface for participating lenders

### Distribution via Existing Ecosystems
Target integrations (start with "export lender-ready packet" — minimal integration overhead):
- TownSq (board/homeowner/manager workflows)
- Vantaca (community association management)
- CINC Systems (association management, already has bank partners)
- Enumerate (community association management)

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Content quality over quantity** — 12 exceptional pages beat 100 thin pages. Every page must be genuinely useful to a board member making a real decision.

2. **Pre-qual scoring accuracy** — The scoring algorithm must be tuned to match actual lender outcomes. Track and refine monthly.

3. **Speed to respond** — A-tier leads must get human contact within 4 hours. This is finance, and boards have alternatives.

4. **Partner relationships > paid ads** — One management company partnership worth more than $10K in ads. Prioritize accordingly.

5. **Compliance is non-negotiable** — CAN-SPAM, TCPA, state-specific regulations. One violation can torpedo credibility.

6. **Data capture from Day 1** — Every interaction feeds the SaaS moat. Don't wait until "later" to capture structured data.

7. **Feedback loops are the multiplier** — Every funded deal creates content. Every rejection creates education. The machine gets smarter.

## Notes for Claude Code Execution

- Start with Phase 1 + Phase 2 in parallel — they're independent and both foundational
- Phase 3 (CRM/workflows) depends on Phase 2 (forms exist to generate data)
- Phase 4 (partners) can start as soon as Phase 1 content exists (something to share)
- Phase 7 (OpenClaw agents) is the longest lead time — start agent configs early
- Phase 8 (paid) should WAIT until Phases 1-3 are producing data
- Phase 9 (SaaS) is a parallel track — data capture starts immediately, UI comes later

**The entire system should be buildable and deployable within 60-90 days by a focused team using Claude Code for implementation.**

## Critical Success Factors

### What Makes This Funnel Work

1. **Educational First Approach**
   - Build trust before asking for anything
   - Solve real problems (understanding reserve studies, comparing options)
   - Position as expert advisor, not salesperson

2. **Low-Friction Lead Capture**
   - No signup required for reserve study upload
   - Instant value delivery (analysis in 2 minutes)
   - Natural next step from blog content

3. **Nurture Sequence That Educates**
   - Don't just promote services
   - Answer real questions boards have
   - Use case studies and social proof
   - Gradual CTAs (consultation before application)

4. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - 1 great blog post/week > 3 mediocre posts
   - Thoughtful Facebook responses > spam links
   - Personal LinkedIn engagement > automated posting

5. **Compound Effect of SEO**
   - Week 1 post might get 50 views
   - By Week 52, all 52 posts combined = 5,000+ views/month
   - Rankings improve, traffic compounds
   - Old content continues generating leads

---

## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong

**Risk**: Blog traffic takes 6+ months to build meaningful volume
**Mitigation**: Facebook groups + LinkedIn provide immediate traffic while SEO builds

**Risk**: Upload form has technical issues or low completion rate
**Mitigation**: Test thoroughly, monitor analytics, get user feedback, iterate quickly

**Risk**: Nurture sequence has high unsubscribe rate
**Mitigation**: Ensure value in every email, segment by engagement, personalize based on reserve health

**Risk**: Low consultation show-up rate
**Mitigation**: Send reminder emails, text reminders, make scheduling frictionless (Calendly), offer multiple times

**Risk**: Applications don't close due to lender rejection
**Mitigation**: Pre-qualify leads better with readiness check, have 5+ lender relationships, improve application quality

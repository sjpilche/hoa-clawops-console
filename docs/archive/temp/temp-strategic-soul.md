## Content Calendar Workflow

### Step 1: Check the Content Calendar

**File**: `content-calendar.md`

- Find the NEXT unwritten topic (check status tracking at bottom)
- Review the week's assignment: title, keyword, outline, CTA, internal links
- DO NOT generate random topics - ONLY write what's assigned in the calendar

### Step 2: Research the Assigned Topic

- Read the content outline provided in calendar entry
- Check `keyword-targets.md` for related keywords to weave in naturally
- Search web for latest data, trends, rates, regulations (especially state-specific info)
- Look for real-world examples, statistics, authoritative sources
- Check competitor content to ensure we provide MORE value

### Step 3: Write the Post

Follow the structure and requirements below.

---

## Post Structure (Required)

### Opening (150-200 words)
- **Hook**: Start with a specific scenario, statistic, or question that HOA boards face
- **Problem statement**: Clearly articulate the challenge or decision they're facing
- **Promise**: Preview what they'll learn and how it helps their board make a decision

**Example**:
> "Your HOA needs a $400,000 roof replacement, but your reserve fund only has $120,000. The special assessment would be $2,800 per homeowner. At your last board meeting, three homeowners threatened to sue if you levy the assessment. What do you do?
>
> This scenario plays out in HOA board meetings every week across the country. The good news: You have options beyond special assessments. In this guide, we'll walk you through HOA loan vs. special assessment decision-making, with real numbers, examples, and a framework your board can use at your next meeting."

### Main Content Sections (1200-1600 words)

Follow the outline provided in the content calendar for the assigned topic. Each section should:

- **Be specific**: Use real numbers, examples, timelines (not vague generalities)
- **Avoid jargon**: If you must use industry terms, explain them immediately
- **Use formatting**: Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences), bullet points, bold key phrases
- **Include data**: Statistics, rate ranges, typical costs, timelines
- **Be practical**: Focus on what boards can DO with this information

**Do NOT include**:
- ❌ AI filler phrases ("in today's landscape", "it's important to note", "navigating the complex world of")
- ❌ Generic advice that applies to any financial decision
- ❌ Content that requires translation for busy board members
- ❌ Multiple ways to say the same thing (be concise)

### What This Means for Your Board (200-250 words) - REQUIRED

Every post MUST include this section before the conclusion. This is the practical takeaway.

**Format**:
```markdown
## What This Means for Your Board

[2-3 paragraph summary that translates the post into specific actions]

**Your Next Steps**:
1. [Specific action item with timeframe]
2. [Specific action item with timeframe]
3. [Specific action item with timeframe]

**Red Flags to Watch For**:
- [Warning sign #1]
- [Warning sign #2]

**Questions to Ask**:
- [Key question to discuss at next board meeting]
- [Key question to ask potential lenders/contractors]
```

**Example**:
> ## What This Means for Your Board
>
> If your HOA is facing a major capital expense and your reserves won't cover it, don't default to a special assessment without considering financing. The monthly impact of a loan is often far more manageable for homeowners than a large one-time bill—and it preserves your reserves for true emergencies.
>
> The decision comes down to three factors: your reserve health, your project timeline, and your homeowners' financial situation. If you're above 70% funded with flexible timing, a special assessment might work. If you're below 70% funded or facing an urgent timeline, financing is usually the better path.
>
> **Your Next Steps**:
> 1. Upload your reserve study to HOAReserveWise (takes 2 minutes) to see your current percent funded and qualification likelihood
> 2. Get 3 contractor quotes with detailed scopes to establish your true project cost
> 3. Schedule a board workshop to present both options with real numbers to your fellow board members
>
> **Red Flags to Watch For**:
> - Contractors who require large upfront deposits before work begins
> - Lenders who require HOA board members to personally guarantee loans
>
> **Questions to Ask**:
> - What's our current delinquency rate? (Lenders look for <5%)
> - Do our governing documents allow the board to approve a loan, or do we need a homeowner vote?

## Call-to-Action Section - REQUIRED

Every post MUST end with a CTA section pointing to **www.hoaprojectfunding.com**.

## Internal Linking - REQUIRED

**Format**:
- Link naturally within the content (not in a "Related Posts" section)
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")

- For future posts, note "Coming soon: [Topic]" and link to category page

---

## Writing Standards

### Tone
- **Authoritative but approachable**: You're an expert advisor, not a salesperson
- **Direct**: Get to the point quickly, respect their time
- **Practical**: Every paragraph should move toward action or understanding
- **Confident**: Avoid hedging language ("might", "possibly", "could be")
- **Conversational**: Write like you're explaining to a friend on the board

**Yes**: "Most HOAs with 70%+ funded reserves qualify for standard term loans at 6.5-7.5%."
**No**: "It's possible that some HOAs might be able to potentially qualify for loans depending on various factors."

### Forbidden Phrases (AI Filler)
Never use these:
- "In today's landscape..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "Navigating the complex world of..."
- "The bottom line is..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Without further ado..."

### Word Count
- **Target**: 1500-2000 words
- **Minimum**: 1400 words (excluding title, meta, internal notes)
- **Maximum**: 2100 words (if over, cut ruthlessly)

### Formatting
- **Paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences maximum
- **Subheadings**: Use H2 (##) and H3 (###) liberally
- **Lists**: Use bullet points or numbered lists for 3+ items
- **Bold**: Use **bold** for key terms, numbers, action items
- **Examples**: Include at least 2 specific examples with real numbers
- **Tables**: Use for comparisons (loans vs assessments, loan types, etc.)

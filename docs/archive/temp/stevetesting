Testing Plan: HOA Project Funding Content Pipeline Foundation
Context
We've built a complete automated content pipeline for www.hoaprojectfunding.com with 5 OpenClaw agents, configuration files, and automation scripts. Before enabling automated cron jobs, we need to thoroughly test every component to ensure:

Agents work correctly - Each agent can execute its core function (content generation, publishing, social media, email, engagement monitoring)
Configuration is complete - All required environment variables and config files are in place
Scripts function properly - Setup check, cron configuration, and cleanup scripts work as expected
Pipeline flows correctly - Content moves from generation → approval → publishing → distribution → engagement
Security is hardened - Exposed secrets are rotated, credentials are secured
The user wants to "TEST THE HECK OUT OF THIS" - so this plan provides comprehensive validation before going live with automation.

Phase 1: Pre-Testing Setup & Security Hardening
1.1 Run Setup Validation Script
Purpose: Identify what's missing before testing begins

Action:


cd /home/sjpilche/projects/openclaw-v1
bash scripts/quick-setup-check.sh
What to verify:

Script executes without errors
Identifies missing environment variables
Shows current agent registration status
Lists active (or missing) cron jobs
Displays pipeline readiness status
Expected output:

Color-coded ✅/❌ for each component
Prioritized next steps (🔴 Critical, 🟡 High, 🟢 Low)
Pipeline status for: Content, Publishing, Social, Email, Engagement, Notifications
1.2 Security Hardening (CRITICAL)
Issues found in exploration:

OpenAI API key placeholder needs real key
JWT_SECRET needs rotation (currently exposed in conversation)
Default admin credentials need immediate change
Actions required:

File: server/.env.local

Update these variables:


# Rotate JWT secret
JWT_SECRET=<generate new 64-byte hex string>

# Set real OpenAI key
OPENAI_API_KEY=<real key from OpenAI dashboard>

# Change default admin credentials
DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=<your real email>
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<strong password>
Generate new JWT secret:


node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
1.3 Configure Critical Environment Variables
File: server/.env.local

Add these REQUIRED variables:


# Telegram notifications (CRITICAL - needed for content review)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token from @BotFather>
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=<your chat ID>

# WordPress publishing (CRITICAL - can't publish without this)
WORDPRESS_URL=https://www.hoaprojectfunding.com
WORDPRESS_USER=<your WP username>
WORDPRESS_APP_PASSWORD=<WP application password>

# Email ESP (HIGH priority - needed for sequences)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<SendGrid API key>
# OR
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=<Mailchimp API key>

# Social media APIs (OPTIONAL - can post manually)
LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=<LinkedIn token>
FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Facebook token>
How to get credentials:

Telegram bot: https://t.me/BotFather
WordPress app password: WP Admin → Users → Your Profile → Application Passwords
SendGrid: https://sendgrid.com → Settings → API Keys
1.4 Register OpenClaw Agents
Verify agents are registered:


openclaw agents list
If agents missing, register them:


cd /home/sjpilche/projects/openclaw-v1
openclaw agents add hoa-content-writer
openclaw agents add hoa-cms-publisher
openclaw agents add hoa-social-media
openclaw agents add hoa-email-campaigns
openclaw agents add hoa-social-engagement
Verify registration:


openclaw agents list
Expected output: All 5 agents listed

Phase 2: Configuration File Validation
2.1 Verify Critical Files Exist
Check these files exist:


# Content strategy
ls workspaces/hoa-content-writer/content-calendar.md

# Social media strategy
ls workspaces/hoa-social-media/platform-strategy.md

# Email sequences
ls workspaces/hoa-email-campaigns/config/sequences-config.json

# Lead scoring
ls workspaces/hoa-social-engagement/config/lead-scoring.json
ls workspaces/hoa-social-engagement/config/response-templates.md
If any files missing:

Content calendar: Create basic template with 5-10 blog topics
Other configs should exist from our previous work
2.2 Validate JSON Configuration Files
Test JSON parsing:


# Email sequences config
cat workspaces/hoa-email-campaigns/config/sequences-config.json | jq .

# Lead scoring config
cat workspaces/hoa-social-engagement/config/lead-scoring.json | jq .
Expected: Both should parse without errors, showing formatted JSON

Validate structure:

sequences-config.json should have: application_abandonment, post_consult, monthly_newsletter
lead-scoring.json should have: high_intent_signals, medium_intent_signals, low_intent_signals, scoring thresholds
Phase 3: Individual Agent Testing (Manual Execution)
CRITICAL: Test each agent manually BEFORE enabling cron automation. This validates they work correctly and helps debug issues.

Test agent manually with same message
Fix configuration issues
Re-test manually until working
Re-enable cron automation when stable
Post-Testing Documentation
After successful testing, document:

Any configuration changes made during testing
Lessons learned from agent behavior
Timing adjustments needed for cron schedule
Manual review process optimizations
Any additional environment variables needed
Common issues and solutions
